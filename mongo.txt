===============================================================================================================
1️⃣ Core MongoDB Topics (Must-Know)
===============================================================================================================
1. What is MongoDB & when to use it vs MySQL
* MongoDB is a NoSQL.
* MongoDB is Document orientated Database That store data in JSON-Like documents (BSON)
        > Data is stored as documents
        > Documents are grouped into collections

Example (MongoDB document)
{
  "_id": "123",
  "name": "Arun",
  "email": "arun@gmail.com",
  "orders": [
    { "orderId": 1, "amount": 500 },
    { "orderId": 2, "amount": 1200 }
  ]
}

When to Use MongoDB
-------------------
* Data structure is dynamic or frequently changing (You can add or remove data on any time)
* You need fast development and flexibility
* Application handles large volumes of data
* Data is hierarchical or nested
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Document, Collection, Database
 -----------------------------
 * Document is one single record on Collection (Like table row).
 * Collection is a collections of multiple records (Like Table).
 * Database is Collection of multiple Collections.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BSON vs JSON
------------
JSON is for communication from bach end to front end, BSON is for store on mongo db its like "Machine language" 

    JSON
    * JSON (Java Script Object Notation) is humab readable format.

    BSON
    * BSON (Binary JSON) is not human readable
    * BSON is read and write is very fast
    * It has additional data Types
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Schema-less vs schema validation
--------------------------------
    Schema less:
    * Schema less means in same document have different key and values
        Its makes easy to change requirements.
        Fast development.
        Don't alter table.

    schema validation:
    * MongoDB allow schema validation using JSON Schema
        Still its get flexibility.
        But with rules.

| Feature     | Schema-less  | Schema validation |
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Structure   | Not enforced | Rules enforced    |
| Flexibility | Very high    | Controlled        |
| Data safety | Low          | High              |
| Best for    | Prototypes   | Production        |

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Embedded documents vs references
--------------------------------
    Embedded documents: 
    * Embedded documents means can store related documents on same documents.

        When use embedded documents:
            * One Read gives everything
            * No Joins needed
            * One to few relationship
            * Data doesn't grow infinitely
        
        When Embedded is bad:
            * Embedded of arrays grow too large
            * Data Update frequently
            * Data shared by many documents

    References:
    * References means stored data separatlely and link them using an ID.

        When References is good
            * One-To-Many (Large Data)
            * Many-To-Many Relation ship
            * Data reuse across collections
            * Data grow with out limit

        When References is bad
            * Too many Joins
            * Its make slow reads

===============================================================================================================
📌 CRUD Operations
===============================================================================================================
insertOne, insertMany
---------------------
    insertOne:
        insertOne() is used to insert one document into a collection
    
    insertMany:
        insertMany is used to insert multiple documents at once

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
find, findOne
---------------------

    findOne:
        findOne() returns only one matching document.
    
    find:
        find() returns all matching documents.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Filters ($eq, $ne, $in, $nin)
-----------------------------
    $eq -> Match exact value
        eg. db.users.find({ age: { $eq: 25 } })

    $ne -> Match values NOT equal to something
        eg. db.users.find({ city: { $ne: "Chennai" } })

    $in -> Value should be in given arrays
        eg. db.users.find({ city: { $in: ["Chennai", "Bangalore"] } })

    $nin -> Value should not be in given arrays
        eg. db.users.find({ city: { $nin: ["Chennai", "Bangalore"] } })
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Projection
----------
    * Projection is used to choose which field need to retuen on fields
    
| Value | Meaning       |
| ----- | ------------- |
| `1`   | include field |
| `0`   | exclude field |


    * Projection in MongoDB is used to specify which fields should be included or excluded in query results,
     helping reduce data size and improve performance.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sorting, Pagination (skip, limit)
---------------------------------

    * Sorting means ordering the results
        1 → ascending (A → Z, small → big)
       -1 → descending (Z → A, big → small)
            eg. db.users.find().sort({ age: 1 })

    * Pagination (limit & skip)
        Show data page by page insted of everything
            eg. db.users.find().limit(5)
                db.users.find().skip(5)
                db.users.find().skip(5).limit(5)
                db.users
                    .find()
                    .sort({ createdAt: -1 })
                    .skip(10)
                    .limit(5)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update operators:
-----------------
$set, $unset

$inc, $push, $pull

deleteOne, deleteMany

👉 Expect code-based questions here.

2️⃣ Indexing & Performance (Very Important 🔥)
This is where interviews get serious.


What is an index?


Types of indexes:


Single field


Compound


Text index


Unique index




When indexes improve performance


Downsides of indexes


explain() and query performance

3️⃣ Aggregation Framework (Most Asked)
If you know this well, you stand out.


What is aggregation?


$match


$group


$project


$sort


$lookup (very common)


$unwind


$limit, $skip


Example questions:


“How do you calculate total sales per user?”


“How do you join two collections?”



4️⃣ Data Modeling (Interview Favorite)
They LOVE asking this.


Embedding vs Referencing


One-to-One


One-to-Many


Many-to-Many


How you designed collections in your project
