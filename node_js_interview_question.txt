1.) What is node js?
Node js is runtime environment wher the JS runs on server side.
Node.js based on Event Driven Architecture wher I/O runs as asynchronously and making it light weight and efficient.

2.) What tool is used to make consistent code style?
ESLint is used to make the code consistent.

3.) What is first class function in JS ?
It is fundamental concept of Modern Programing Language. the first-class function means that function are treated like any other variable

4.) How do you manage oackages in your Node.JS Project ?
Create package.json file first it should manage our project dependencies Packages,
Using package-lock.json file for Lock the dependency Tree that means that records the exact versions of all installed packages.

5.) How Node.JS Better that other framework ?
*) Node.JS Basically work with Asynchronus in Nature.
*) Node.JS is Non-Blocking I/O.
*) Its handle req and res concurrently.
*) Its performing with single threading in nature
*) Node.JS is based on Event Drive Architecture.
*) We will use JS to develop the FE & BE Development will be much faster.

6.) How the "control Flow" controls the function calls ?
JS Execute the code line by line, from top to bottom.

7.) Timing features of Node.JS?
*) setTimeOut/clearTimeOut - Used to implement delay in code execution.
*) setInterval/clearInterval - Used to run a code multiple time.
*) setImmediate/clearImmediate - Used to execute in the next itration of the event Loop.
*) process.nextTick - Runs before any I/O events, timers or setImmediate.

8.) What are the advantages of using Promises insted of callbacks ?
*) Avoid Callback Hell.
*) Promise Provide cleaner, flatter and more readable code.
*) Better Error Handling, Promise Have catch() Method for handles errors anywhere in the chain.
*) Promise supports Async/Await

9.) What is fork on node JS ?
*) Fork is a method used to create a new child process.
*) That can be run the task concurrently with the parent process.
*) Fork is used to generate multiple workers to execute the code.

10.) Why node.js single threaded ?
*) Node JS Handle Thousand of I/O request Easily and consurrently
*) Node.JS is designed by non-blockig uses async callback and event loop.

11.) How do you create Simple Server in Nod.JS

var http = require('http');
http.createServer((req: any, res: any)=> {
	res.end('Hello World');
}).listen(3000);


12.) How Many Types of APT function?
There are Two type of API Function:-
Asynchronous, Non-Blocking function.
Synchtonous,Blocking function.

13.) What is REPL is Node.js ?
REPL - Read-Eval-Print-Loop;
*) Read -> Take input from the user.
*) Eval -> Evaluates the input(Display the Output).
*) print -> Print the result.
*) Loop -> Waits for the next inputs.

14.) List down the two arguments that async.queue takes as input ?
*) Worker Function -> that process each task in the queue.
*) Concurrency Value -> A function you must call when the task is done.

15.) What is purpose of module.exports ?
module.exports is used to export functions, objects, variables from a file(module)
So they can use another file via require().
--------------------------------------------------------------------
16.) Explain the concept of stub in Node.js
*)Stub is used to handle test cses when you don't want to call the real function.
*)can able to control the retun value of the function

17.) Describe the exit codes of Node.JS ?
When process exist, it returns an exist code to the OS. this code tell whether the process ended successfully or with an error.

18.) For node.js, why google uses v8engine ?
we have spidermonkey from Firefox & chakra from edge but gooble's v8 is the most evolved & faster.

19.) Why should you separate express app and server ?
Express App(app.js or app.ts) - Handles routes, middleware and business logic.
Serer(server.js or index.js) - Starts the HTTP server.

project/
│
├── app.js        ← Express app (no port/listen)
├── server.js     ← HTTP server (calls app.listen)


Why?
*) can test routes without starting a server
*) Implement Clustering on server.js
*) Easier to scale, easier to test, easier maintain

20.) Explain Reactor pattern in NodeJS

Imagine a restaurant:

Only one waiter.

Customers come in and place orders (e.g., biryani, dosa).

While biryani is being cooked in the kitchen, the waiter doesn’t wait.

He goes to the next customer and takes another order.

When the biryani is ready, the kitchen notifies the waiter → he serves it.


What Happened Here?
Waiter (Node.js) took Customer #1’s order and gave it to the kitchen (libuv).

While it's cooking, he moved to Customer #2 (non-blocking).

When the biryani is ready, the kitchen rang the bell (callback fired).

Waiter served the biryani (callback executed).
=============================================================================
Reactor Pattern in Node.js:
Event loop listens for I/O events (like file read, HTTP request).

Instead of waiting, it continues handling other tasks.

When the I/O finishes, it "reacts" by executing a callback.

21.) What is middleware:-
Middleware is comes in between your request and business logic.
It mainly used to:-
*) Capture Logs,
*) Enable Rate Limit and
*) Handling Authentication.

We ware implemented third pary middleware also that is body-parser


22.) What is Node.js Buffer:-
Buffer is temporary Memory that is mainly used by stream to hold on to some data until consumed
This also support legacy endoding like utf-8

23.) What is node.js streams?
straming = reading or writing data in small parts.
use "const stream = fs.createReadStream('bigfile.txt', 'utf8');" insted of "const data = fs.readFileSync('bigfile.txt');"

24.) How can we use async await in node js ?

async/await is a way to write asynchtonous code that look like synchronous code

function waitOneSecond() {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('⏳ Done after 1 second');
    }, 1000);
  });
}

async function runTask() {
  console.log('⏯️ Start');
  const result = await waitOneSecond();
  console.log(result);  // ⏳ Done after 1 second
  console.log('✅ Finished');
}

runTask();

25.) How does node.js overcome the problem of blocking of I/O operation ?

Request comes to Node.js.

If it’s I/O (e.g. file, DB), Node doesn’t wait.

It sends the work to libuv (native C++ library under Node.js).

When done, libuv notifies Node.js.

The event loop picks the callback and runs it.

26.) Different between process.nextTick() ans setImmediate()
*) setImmediate/clearImmediate - Used to execute in the next itration of the event Loop.
*) process.nextTick - Runs before any I/O events, timers or setImmediate.

27.) Node js single thread then how does it handle concurrency ?

The Libuv sets up a thread pool to handle such concurrency.
That thread pool handling blocking operations, like (fs, dns(lookup), crypto operations)

28.) What is an event-loop in Node JS?

Event loop is a end-less loop and this is heart of node js that allows it perform non-blocking I/O operation. even though its single threaded.

*) It runs asynchronous code to run efficiently
*) It handle thousand of requests with out creating new thread.
*) With out event loop the node js wouldn't be fast or scalable.


29.) What do you understand by callback hell ?
When we write too many nested callbacks making your code
Hard to read,
Hard to maintain,
Hard to debug

30.) What is an event emitter in node js ?
EentEmitter is a build-in class on node.js that can allows you to create, fire, and listen to custom events.

const EventEmitter = require('events');

// Create a new emitter
const emitter = new EventEmitter();

// Register a listener for 'greet' event
emitter.on('greet', (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
});

// Emit the event
emitter.emit('greet', 'Arun');

Use-Case of EentEmitterr in Node.JS
*) Handling custom app-level eents
*) Creating pub-sub architecture
*) Communicate between different part of our app

31.) Enhancing node.js performance through clustering.
By default node.js runs on a single thread, which means
	it uses only 1CPU core.
	It can handle only one event loop.
But modern machines have multiple CPU cores. Clustering allows you to take advantage of all cores and imporve scalability.

How its Work?
Master Processes: Starts and manages worker processes.
Worker Processes: Each in full node.js process with its own memory and event loop.
All Worker share the same port using cluster module.

// server.js
const cluster = require('cluster');
const os = require('os');
const express = require('express');

const numCPUs = os.cpus().length;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  console.log(`Master ${process.pid} is running`);

  // Fork workers
  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }

  // Optional: Listen for dying workers
  cluster.on('exit', (worker) => {
    console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
    cluster.fork(); // Restart the worker
  });
} else {
  const app = express();

  app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send(`Hello from Worker ${process.pid}`);
  });

  app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log(`Worker ${process.pid} started`);
  });
}

| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 💪 Multi-core utilization  | Uses **all CPU cores** for concurrent processing |
| ⚡ Faster response time    | Requests are handled in **parallel**             |

32.) What is thread pool and library handles it in Node js?

*) Thread Pool in node.js is a group of background worker used to handle expensive or blocking tasks outside the main (eent loop) thread.

*) This allows Node.js to stay non-blocking and responsive, even when dealing with heavy I/O operations.

Who handle the Thread Poll?

*) The libuv library handle the thread pool in node.js
*) libuv is a C library that powers Node's eent loop and manages:
	Thread Pool
	Async I/O operation
	Timers
	cross=platform support(Win,Lnx,etc.)	

*) default thread pool is 4 you can increase it up to 128 using.
